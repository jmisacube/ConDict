		<h1>Luskei Grammar</h1>
		<div>
			There are extensive declension rules for nouns in Luskei, as well as rules for the conjugation of verbs. Noun and verb declensions and conjugations are extremely regular; the patterns in the tables below follow for all nouns and verbs with the indicated endings.
		</div>
	</div>
	<div id="tables">
		<h2>Nouns</h2>
		<div>Noun declensions depend on only two factors: plurality, and ending type (consonant or vowel).</div>
		<table>
			<caption>Types of declensions</caption>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<th>Declension</th>
					<th>Meaning</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Nominative</td>
					<td>Basic form. Used for the subject in sentences.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Accusative</td>
					<td>Object form. Used for the direct object of a sentence; the predicate.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Genitive</td>
					<td>Possessive form. Used to indicate possession <span class="italy">by</span> the noun. For example, to refer to the pages in a book, you could say "the book's pages." The pages belong to the book, so the book is genitive.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Dative</td>
					<td>Indirect object form. Used for the indirect object of a sentence. For example, if Wes gives a book to me, I am the indirect object, whereas the book is the direct object.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Instrumental</td>
					<td>This form indicates the meaning of "with" or "by means of." For example, if I go to work by train, the train is the instrumental noun.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Prepositional</td>
					<td>This form indicates a location. For example, if I am at the train station, the station is the prepositional noun.</td>
				</tr>

		<h2>Verbs</h2>
		<div>
			Verbs in Luskei are conjugated according to who the performer of the action is. Luskei also uses the concept of aspects, meaning that verbs are either perfective or imperfective. All verbs listed in the dictionary are displayed in their infinitive, imperfective form. All verbs in their infinitive form (<span class="italy">"to ___"</span>) end with the <span class="italy">-sx</span> suffix. The cluster before this suffix is called the <span class="italy">verb stem</span>. All conjugations listed below are in the form of a suffix, which is added to the verb stem, replacing the infinitive suffix. Note that when conjugating verbs, word stress never changes place.
		</div>
		<table>

		<h3>Aspects and moods</h3>
		<div>The imperfective aspect emphasizes the fact that the action is incomplete at the time of speaking, wherever in time the action takes place. The perfective aspect on the other hand, emphasizes the completeness of a task, e.g., expressing that a book has been read completely from cover to cover. If a perfective verb does not have a past tense modifier, it implies the intent to finish the action in the future. The emphasis is on the fact that the action will be done, not what the action is or what needs to be done to accomplish it. To make a verb perfective, just prefix the verb with <span class="italy">plo-</span>:</div>
		<div class="example">cxitasx -&gt; plocxitasx</div>
		<div>Word stress never changes when making a verb perfective.</div>
		<div>Verbs are made past tense with the suffix <span class="italy">-av</span> for consonant-ending verb stems, or <span class="italy">-v</span> for vowel-ending verb stems:</div>
		<div class="example">Wo govary -&gt; Wo govarav<br>Wo cxitawy -&gt; Wo cxitav</div>
		<div>The imperative mood (e.g., "Read this, please") can be made by adding the suffix <span class="italy">-izi</span> for consonant-ending verb stems, or <span class="italy">-zi</span> for vowel-ending verb stems:</div>
		<div class="example">"Govarizi, plosxa." = "Say it, please."<br>"Cxitazi, plosxa." = "Read it, please."</div>
		<h3>Future and progressive tenses</h3>
		<div>Although the plain perfective form of a verb implies the future completion of the action, it only does that one thing. In order to express the ideas of <span class="italy">doing something</span> in the future, or even working on something currently, we need tenses. The application is simple: to indicate a future progression ("I will be ..."), say <span class="italy">bity</span>, the future-tense form of the irregular verb <span class="italy">bi</span> "to be," before the regularly-conjugated verb.</div>
		<div class="example">"Sa <span class="italy">bity</span> cxitawit" = "They will be reading"</div>
		<div>The <span class="italy">bity</span> stem does not conjugate depending on the performer of the action. To indicate a present-tense progressive form, we use the basic present-tense form of <span class="italy">bi</span>:</div>
		<div class="example">"Wo <span class="italy">bi</span> cxitawy" = "I am reading"</div>
		<div>For past tense, we use the past-tense form, <span class="italy">biv</span>:</div>
		<div class="example">"Ty <span class="italy">biv</span> cxitawesx" = "You were reading"</div>

		<h2>Adjectives</h2>
		<div>Adjectives in Luskei conjugate very simply. All adjectives end with the stem <span class="italy">-y</span>, and the only declension is for agreement with plural nouns. To make the plural declension, replace the final <span class="italy">y</span> with <span class="italy">i</span>.</div>
		<div class="example">"Cxorny samoxit" = "Black car";<br>"Cxorni samoxiti" = "Black cars".</div>
		<h3>Making adverbs</h3>
		<div>To make an adverb out of an adjective, replace the <span class="italy">-y</span> ending with <span class="italy">-o</span>.</div>
		<div class="example">Dabny -&gt; Dabno</div>
		<h3>Comparatives</h3>
		<div>To make an adjective comparative (e.g., taller, higher, etc.), add a <span class="italy">-e</span> suffix to the end of the adjective.</div>
		<div class="example">"Dabny" = "good";</br>"Dabnye" = "better".</div>
		<div>To make the surperlative (e.g., tallest, highest, etc.), add a <span class="italy">-ec</span> suffix to the end of the adjective.</div>
		<div class="example">"Pwekny" = "beautiful";</br>"Pweknyec" = "most beautiful".</div>
